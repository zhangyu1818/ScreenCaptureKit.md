Initializer

# init(display:excludingApplications:exceptingWindows:)

Creates a filter that captures a display, excluding windows of the specified apps.

Mac Catalyst 18.2+macOS 12.3+

``` source
init(
    display: SCDisplay,
    excludingApplications applications: [SCRunningApplication],
    exceptingWindows: [SCWindow]
)
```

## Parameters 

`display`  

A display to capture.

`applications`  

An array of apps to exclude from capture.

`exceptingWindows`  

An array of windows that are exceptions to the previous rules.

## Discussion

The initializer arguments provide a three-stage filter that gives you fine-grained control over the output:

1.  Specify a display to capture. If you donâ€™t specify additional filter criteria, the stream includes all content for a display.

2.  Specify one or more apps with windows to exclude from the output.

3.  Specify one or more windows that are exceptions to the previous rules. If the previous rules include a window, specifying it as an exception excludes it from the output. Likewise, if the previous rules exclude a window, specifying it as an exception includes it in the output.
