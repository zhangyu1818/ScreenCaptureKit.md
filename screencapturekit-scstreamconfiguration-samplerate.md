# sampleRate

The sample rate for audio capture.

Mac Catalyst 16.1+macOS 13.0+

``` source
var sampleRate: Int { get set }
```

## Discussion

The framework supports sample rates of `8000`, `16000`, `24000`, and `48000`. If you donâ€™t specify a sample rate, or specify an unsupported value, the system uses a default sample rate of 48 kHz.
