Instance Property

# queueDepth

The maximum number of frames for the queue to store.

Mac Catalyst 18.2+macOS 12.3+

``` source
var queueDepth: Int { get set }
```

## Discussion

By default, the system sets the queue depth to its minimum value of three frames. Specifying more frames uses more memory, but may allow you to process frame data without stalling the display stream.

Important

Donâ€™t exceed a queue depth of eight frames.
